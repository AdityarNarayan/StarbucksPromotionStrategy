# Installation and Instructions <a name="Installation"></a>:
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python which can be found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/). The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

The repository can be cloned or downloaded and used as is. All code should run locally without issues as long as the appropriate packages are installed on your machine.

# Project Motivation <a name='Motivation'></a>

This project was offered by [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.ca/). The motivation of the project was to evaluate a Starbucks' promotion strategy based on some predetermined metrics using statistical analysis. The data given is based on an experiment that was run by Starbucks themselves. The second part of the project involves optimizing their promotion strategy and evaluating the success of it.

Also, I want to encourage pull requests and further analysis on top of this project! I would love to see what the open source community could contribute to a project like this.

# File Descriptions <a name="Descriptions"></a>

#### test and training data
The training data was used to evaluate the success of their blind experiment and to train a model that would predict which individuals would use the promotion to make a purchase. The testing data was used to evaluate the model.
#### Starbucks.pynb
This notebook contains the full process and outline for the project.
#### test_results.py
This python file contains two basic functions that are used in the notebook to test specific metrics of our model.

Thanks must go to [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.ca/) for giving me access to this data set and allowing me to use it for this analysis.
